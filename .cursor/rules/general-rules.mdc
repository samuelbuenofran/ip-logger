// All configuration files (such as database or app settings) should be placed in the "/config/" folder;

// Our project should follow separation of concerns;

// The config folder contains two configuration files: config.php for cloud/production deployment and config.local.php for local deployment on a user's PC;

// All pure HTML files and templates should be placed in the dedicated "/templates/" folder, keeping markup separate from logic and assets;
